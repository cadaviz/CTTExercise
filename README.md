# CTT Exercise

## Description

This is a backend service built with .NET 8 and MongoDB to register and retrieve product information. It was developed as part of an exercise to demonstrate good development practices, including TDD, containerization, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

## Features

- **Register a product**
  - POST `products` 
  - Request:
    ```json
    {
      "description": "string",
      "stock": "int",
      "categories": [
        "uuid"
      ],
      "price": "string"
    }
    ```

- **Retrieve product details**
  - GET `products/{id}`
  - Response:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "description": "string",
      "stock": "int",
      "categories": [
        "uuid"
      ],
      "price": "string"
    }
    ```

## Tests
All business logic was written following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.
To run the tests:

```bash
dotnet test
```

## Run Locally with Docker
- Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CTTExercise.git
cd CTTExercise\CTTExercise_Container
```

- Start the app using Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
The API will be available at: http://localhost:5000

## Stack

- [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

## CI/CD
This project uses GitHub Actions to:

- Build and run tests
- Publish Docker images
- Automatically create a Pull Request with Kubernetes manifests (from k8s/ folder)

## Deployment
All Kubernetes manifests are located in the k8s/ folder.
Whenever code is pushed to the main branch, a Pull Request is automatically created with these manifests.

## Assumptions
- UUIDs are generated by the backend.

## Possible Improvements
- Product update and delete endpoints
- Authentication and authorization
- API versioning
